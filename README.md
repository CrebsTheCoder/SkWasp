# Continued Fork of SkBee
Why did I fork SkBee? Well you see, Shane has said he would stop working on SkBee for reasons, read his statement [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skbee-skript-addon.75839/). I have decided to continue this fork of SkBee as it is a useful plugin. Please note I will **NOT** add anymore features, I am just simply updating it to support latest versions of Minecraft & Skript.

# SkWasp alternative

[**SkriptHub/SkBee**](https://github.com/SkriptHub/SkBee/)

[**EquipableMC/Skbee-Continued**](https://github.com/EquipableMC/SkBee-Continued)


**SkWasp** is a Skript Addon which is a fork of [**SkBee**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) / [**Skbee-Continued**](https://github.com/EquipableMC/SkBee-Continued) that aims to add more useful elements to [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript).

# State of SkBee 
Shane has made the github public again, but archived the repository. He is no longer continuing SkBee. This fork simply just updates SkBee. If you want a fork that will be updated with new features and such, go to Fusezion's [SkImagine](https://github.com/Fusezion/SkImagine) addon here for more information.
